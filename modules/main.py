    or better yet:
    
    On C:\<User Name>\Documents\maya\scripts
        create a file named: "userSetup.Py"

With the following â†“ code inside:

# Import sys to append modules path to sys.path        
import sys

TOOLS_PATH = "D:/Projects/VS Code/Maya" # Put the location of the module

sys.path.append(TOOLS_PATH)

sys.dont_write_bytecode = True # Stops the .pyc for being created

>> DEPENDENCIES >>
    - Maya cmds and OpenMaya (Requieres Autodesk Maya, pre-installed)
    - six (python.exe -m pip install six) [install trough pip]

>> NOTES >> 
	Update 02/08/2023 : Start working on the script.
